Messy port of the Dalamud BotManager code to a plugin. It only does one-way in-game FFXIV chat to Discord relaying.

Allows for easy transfer of settings from DalamudSettings.json as it keeps all the same structures.

Allows for all channel info to be edited inside the game, but you're probably better off waiting for the official Dalamud.DiscordBridge project as that will be coded much nicer and by not-me.
